title: "About me"
---

I am Devon Romanko, a senior software engineer at DICK's Sporting Goods. I work remotely from Pittsburgh, PA.

I am primarily a Java developer but I am also comfortable on the front end with Angular. I love building resilient applications that keep working when things go wrong, writing tools/scripts that help other developers be more efficient, and reviewing code from my peers. My current hobby language has been Go for the past few years and I look for any excuse to use it.

A few of my favorite things outside of tech include yoga, meditation, video games, and single-origin coffee. I have been practicing yoga since 2017, practicing meditation since 2019, and playing video games my whole life.
